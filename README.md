## Tools
- Python
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Time
- Windrose
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- Keras

## Approach

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Conducted thorough EDA to gain insights into the wind energy dataset.

### 2. Data Visualization
- Created various plots to visualize the data, including wind direction vs. wind speed, KDE plots, and more.

### 3. Forecasting with LSTM
- Utilized an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for wind energy forecasting. LSTM is well-suited for time series data and can capture long-term dependencies.

### 4. Model Evaluation
- Evaluated the LSTM-based forecasting model's performance using the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) metric, achieving an MAPE of 0.4612.

## Visualizations

### Wind Direction vs. Wind Speed
- Visualized the relationship between wind direction and wind speed using appropriate plots.

### KDE Plot
- Utilized Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to visualize the distribution of wind data.

### 3. Final Prediction Plot
- Displayed the final predictions made by the LSTM forecasting model.

## Conclusion

The Wind Energy Forecasting project successfully implemented an LSTM-based forecasting model for predicting wind energy generation. The model's performance was rigorously evaluated using the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE), achieving a respectable MAPE score of 0.4612. Visualizations were used to provide insights into wind energy trends and patterns, aiding in decision-making for power generation.
