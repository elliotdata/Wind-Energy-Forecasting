# Wind Energy Forecasting 

## Task Details

- Perfromed EDA to gain insights into the wind energy dataset.
  
- Created various plots to visualize the data, including wind direction vs. wind speed, KDE plots, and more.

- Utilized an LSTM neural network to predict and forecast power generated by wind turbines. 

- Evaluated the LSTM-based forecasting model's performance using the Mean Absolute Percent Error (MAPE) metric, getting a MAPE of 0.4612.
